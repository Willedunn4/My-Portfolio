This is my Portfolio, it contains some of the projects that I've either made myself or at least helped out with

## Projects

Below are the screenshots to projects that I have worked on

## Scavenger Run (Adventure Game)

Scavenger Run is a text-based rpg game where you play as Adam Roosevelt. You must escape with the treasure from the 5 guardians by strategically using the items you have or else they will catch you and kill you. 

## Study Application

The Study Application project is meant to be a little bit of a study guide. It gives you definitions, asks you to study them, then waits until you are ready to begin the quiz. At the end, it will tell you how many answers you got correct and how many you got wrong.

## Explorable Areas

The ToEarlyCantThink Project, is a program where the user, after imputing their name, get to explore multiple rooms, get different items, and based off of those items, they will get multiple endings.

## Underwater Creatures

The Underwater Creatures Project, is one of the more complicated types of code. You get to feed 4 different types of sea animals where you can listen to them and understand what they need in order to survive. 

## Shift Cypher

The Shift Cyper project is a bunch of code designed to either encode or decode any sentence into a bunch of letters/numbers. 

## Trivia Game

The Trivia Game project is meant to be a smaller version of the study application, performing the same tasks as it. Although, it does not tell you to study, it expects you to know what the answers to the questions are and at the end it will tell you how many you got correct and how many you got wrong.
