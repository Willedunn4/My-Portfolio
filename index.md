# Will's Portfolio

This is my Portfolio, it contains some of the projects that I've either made myself or at least helped out with

## Projects

Below are the screenshots to projects that I have worked on

### Scavenger Run (Adventure Game)
![Scavenger Run Screenshot](/Pictures/Scavenger-Run-Screenshot.JPG)
Scavenger Run is a game where you play as Adam Roosevelt. You must escape with the treasure from the 5 guardians by strategically using the items you have or else they will catch you and kill you. 

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Willedunn4/My-Portfolio/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
